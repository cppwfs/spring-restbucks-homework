= Spring Restbucks Homework

A multi-component project demonstrating a microservices architecture for a coffee shop ordering system, built with Spring Boot and related technologies.

== Overview

This project implements a distributed coffee shop system with the following components:

* **Server** - Main Spring Boot application providing the core ordering system
* **Dashboard** - Microservice for capturing purchase events and displaying revenue statistics

== Architecture

The system uses:

* Spring Boot 3.2.0 with Java 17
* RabbitMQ for messaging between services
* RESTful APIs for service communication
* JavaMoney (Moneta) for currency handling
* Maven for Java components build management

== Prerequisites

* Java 17 or higher
* Maven 3.6+ (or use the included Maven wrapper)
* RabbitMQ server (for message processing between services)
